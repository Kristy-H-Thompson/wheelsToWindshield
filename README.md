## Description
This application prompts the user to either create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle. After going through the creation or selection process, the user is able to perform certain actions with the selected vehicle(Such as start the car, speed up, slow down, ect). The user is returned to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application.

- What was your motivation for creating this project?
I created this project to practice using Node.js and Typescript in a fun way. While I have used Javascript in a lot of previous projects, I am new to using Typescript. 

- What did I learn? 
I learned how use Typescript in a practical way, to help prevent type errors.

## User Story
- AS a developer I WANT to update an existing application to include additional vehicle types SO THAT I am able to comprehend and work with existing code bases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted to create a new vehicle or existing vehicle, THEN I can choose between the two options
- WHEN I am prompted to choose the vehicle type during creation, THEN I can choose between car, truck, and motorbike
- WHEN I am prompted for details about the vehicle, THEN I can enter the vehicle information
- WHEN I have entered all the vehicle information, THEN I can use the created vehicle
- WHEN I select an existing vehicle, THEN I can use the selected existing vehicle
- WHEN I have created a new vehicle or selected an existing vehicle, THEN I can perform actions with that vehicle
- WHEN I perform an action with a vehicle, THEN I see the result of the action in the command-line
- WHEN I complete the process of performing an action, THEN I can perform additional actions until I choose to exit
